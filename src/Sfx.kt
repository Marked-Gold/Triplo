 * korlibs 6.0 quirk: PlaybackParameters.pitch is stored on the SoundChannel but the platform audio
 * output is opened at the source AudioData's native rate, so the pitch value is silently ignored.
 * To actually pitch a sound we therefore ship the rate ourselves — see [playPitched] — by wrapping
 * the decoded PCM in a fresh AudioData whose rate field is multiplied by the desired pitch ratio.
 * Same samples, just told to render faster, which is what the ear hears as a higher pitch.
